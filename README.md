# Kristy_Bot
An IRC bot with probably Rizon specific commands. Requires two external libraries which you can obtain from here;

Javax.mail-1-5-4

Pircbot

http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php

There is an external .properties file with sensitive data (passwords and such) that will be required to run the program. The bot has the following major functions and many smaller minor ones;

1. Ability to read Inboxes, detect titles, set flags as well as write emails.
2. A giveaway system that chooses a random non-admin user in the channel. Complete with a 30 minute timer to accept with the !accept command.
3. Modular adding of new commands. Thanks to XSpeedPL.
4. Parser for usernames and an internal ranking system (VOICE, HALF-OP, OP, ADMIN)
